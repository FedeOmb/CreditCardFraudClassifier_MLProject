# Credit Card Frauds Classifier
## Machine Learning Project

The goal of this project is to create a **classifier algorithm** that can identify credit card fraudolent transactions.

The **Dataset** used to train the model contains a list of transactions labeled as fraudolent or genuine and it is avaliable on *kaggle*.com at the link [ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud ] 

## Project Structure
1. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Pre-Processing
3. Model Selection
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors classifier
   - Neural Network - MLP
4. Model Assessment

Details and results of the project are described in the Python Notebook
